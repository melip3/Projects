					<h3>Steps</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Cook the pasta according to the package directions; drain and rinse with cold water, then set aside.</li>
							<li>Meanwhile, sprinkle the chicken with 2 teaspoons of jerk seasoning.</li>
							<li>Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat the grill pan with 1 tablespoon oil. Add the chicken and cook on one side until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over and sprinkle with the brown sugar. Cook until the chicken registers 165&deg;F when a thermometer is inserted in the thickest portion, 6 to 8 minutes more. Remove the chicken from the pan, and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing into thin strips.</li>
							<li>Add the bell peppers to the grill pan. Cook until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the peppers from the pan and set aside.</li>
							<li>Melt the butter and remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant and tender. Add the sauce powder and flour and whisk until incorporated. Reduce the heat, then slowly whisk in the half-and-half. Simmer until the mixture begins to thicken, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat, then stir in the Parmesan and remaining teaspoon of jerk seasoning.</li>
							<li>Add the pasta, chicken and peppers to the sauce and toss until combined. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and garnish with green onions and the extra Parmesan.</li>
